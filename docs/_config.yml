about:
  - >
      My personal mission is to give to society through technology. 
      I am always eager to learn, and I often get obsessed with accomplishing tasks â€” the more 
      difficult the better. The time I spend heavily working on projects alone does not mean 
      I spend any less closely collaborating. I am constantly looking for ways to
      improve myself and help those around me.
  - >
      I love exercising my creativity by playing guitar or painting, especially with 
      friends. I also enjoy going outside to play soccer or for a long hike.
